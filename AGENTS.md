# AGENTS.md — Read Before Touching This Repo

This file is the source of truth for any AI agent (Claude, Copilot, Cursor,
etc.) working on CloseTool. It is also valid as `CLAUDE.md`. If guidance here
conflicts with a passing remark in chat, **this file wins** unless the user
explicitly overrides it in writing.

---

## 0. Pre-flight: are you in the right place?

Before doing **anything** — reading files, running commands, planning —
verify all three:

1. **Canonical project path** (Windows):
   `C:\Users\Joe\OneDrive - Healthcare Markets DBA\Desktop\Claude Projects\CloseTool`
   This is the *only* folder that contains the real CloseTool. Other
   `app.py` files on Joe's machine (`C:\Users\Joe\app.py`,
   `C:\Users\Joe\Downloads\app.py`, `C:\Users\Joe\Desktop\Claude Projects\close-tracker\app.py`)
   are stale graveyards. Do not edit them. Do not "merge" from them.
2. **You are inside a git repo whose remote is**
   `gutte001-lgtm/-C-Users-Joe-OneDrive...-Desktop-Accounting-Tools`.
   Run `git remote -v` to confirm. If it says anything else (or "fatal:
   not a git repository"), you are in the wrong folder — stop and tell
   the user.
3. **You are not in `C:\Users\Joe`.** That folder accidentally became a
   git repo once. Never run `git init`, `git add`, or `git commit` from
   `C:\Users\Joe` or any folder outside the canonical project path.
   If `git status` from `C:\Users\Joe` ever shows a branch name,
   the home-folder `.git` has reappeared and must be deleted before
   doing anything else.

Sanity check — run inside the project folder, all should pass:

```
git remote -v        # → ...gutte001-lgtm/...Accounting-Tools
git rev-parse --show-toplevel   # → ...\Claude Projects\CloseTool
ls app.py            # → file exists
```

## 1. The #1 rule: there is no login screen

CloseTool runs locally on the owner's machine (`http://127.0.0.1:5000`) as a
single-tenant accounting tool. The login screen has been **permanently
removed**. Do not reintroduce it, and do not add any auth gate — session,
token, basic-auth, OAuth, SSO, magic link, PIN, or otherwise — without
explicit written instruction from the repo owner (Joe).

### How "no login" is wired today

Backend (`app.py`):
- `get_current_user()` always returns user id `DEFAULT_USER_ID` (1 = Joe, admin).
- `login_required` and `admin_required` are **no-op pass-throughs**. The
  decorators are left on routes intentionally so that if auth is ever
  reinstated on purpose, the surface area is already marked. Do not strip
  them — that's churn, and it loses the signal.
- `/api/auth/me` always responds `authenticated: true` with Joe's profile.
- `/api/auth/login` and `/api/auth/logout` have been deleted. If a stale
  client calls them the 404 is intentional.
- Neither `session` nor `check_password_hash` nor `generate_password_hash`
  are imported anymore.

Database / `init_db.py`:
- The `users` table has no `username` or `password_hash` columns. Don't
  add them back.
- Don't ALTER TABLE the schema to re-introduce auth columns. The legacy
  `setup_auth.py` script has been deleted from the repo for this reason.

Frontend (`static/index.html`):
- The `LoginScreen` component has been deleted.
- The `authChecked` state and the `if(!currentUser) return <LoginScreen/>`
  gate have been deleted. On load, the app calls `/api/auth/me`, seeds
  `currentUser` with Joe, and drops straight into the dashboard.
- The "Sign Out" button has been removed from the sidebar.
- `handleLogout` has been deleted.
- The Add User and Edit User modals do not collect `username` or
  `password`. The Settings → Team Members table shows `Email`, not
  `Username`. Don't add those fields back.

### If the user asks you to re-add auth

1. Ask first. Confirm scope (who needs to log in, is it multi-user now,
   network-exposed?).
2. Update this file in the same PR.
3. Do not just "wire up the existing login screen" — it no longer exists.

---

## 2. Why this matters (two real incidents, both about duplicated work)

### 2a. The "crossed swords" incident (2026-04-21)

An agent claimed to have removed the login screen overnight on branch
`claude/fix-login-screen-removal-2EuuX`. In fact, **nothing was committed
or pushed** — only the initial commit existed. The user came back the
next morning, still saw the login screen, and (reasonably) lost trust.

### 2b. The "8 parallel branches" incident (2026-04-22)

A week of sessions produced eight `claude/*` branches — each branching
off the original `master` (initial commit only), each solving the same
problems in isolation:

| Problem | Solved (again) on branch |
| --- | --- |
| Remove login screen | `fix-login-screen-removal-2EuuX`, `remove-login-screen-Rc77n`, `fix-accounting-button-B9RTl`, `close-tool-next-steps-8Y8oZ` |
| Add reports | `close-tracker-tools-JVRS3` (canned ledgers), `fix-accounting-button-B9RTl` (P&L/BS/CF + KPIs) |
| Fiscal calendar / periods | `month-end-close-tool-5eQcQ`, `fix-accounting-button-B9RTl` |
| `.gitignore` for pycache | `close-tool-next-steps-8Y8oZ`, `review-close-tool-dG5XJ`, `remove-login-screen-Rc77n`, …every new branch |

Nothing landed on `master`. The user's local `git pull` on `master`
fetched the initial commit and nothing else, so every session's "it's
fixed" looked like a lie from the user's chair. The eventual cleanup
required surveying every branch, picking one (`fix-accounting-button-B9RTl`)
as canonical, and fast-forwarding `master` to it.

### Lessons, in priority order

1. **If you say you did it, it must be committed AND pushed to the named
   branch.** Run `git log --oneline origin/<branch>` before declaring victory.
2. **Verify the change actually reaches the user.** For UI changes that
   means: boot the app, hit the URL, confirm the old screen is gone. A
   passing test or a clean diff is not proof the user will see the fix.
3. **Check for prior work before starting.** See §4a. The user almost
   certainly already asked another agent to do this. Look.
4. **Do not leave the task partway and claim completion.** If you ran out
   of turns, say so explicitly in the final message.
5. **Never undo a previous agent's completed work without a stated reason.**
   If you find the login screen back in `index.html`, treat it as a
   regression — check git history, ask the user, and restore the no-auth
   state. Do not "helpfully" add auth back.

## 3. Project shape (quick map)

- `app.py` — Flask API + static file server. Single file on purpose.
- `init_db.py` — schema + seed data. Idempotent; safe to re-run.
- `static/index.html` — Single-file React app (Babel-standalone, no build
  step). Edit this file directly.
- `closeapp.db` — SQLite, created on first run. Git-ignored.
- `requirements.txt` — pip deps.

(There used to be a `setup_auth.py` here that added username/password
columns. It has been deleted. See Section 1.)

### API conventions

- Resource creation is `POST /api/<resource>` (not `/api/<resource>/create`).
  This applies to `users`, `categories`, `tasks`, `periods`, and
  `reconciliations`. The frontend assumes this convention — don't reintroduce
  the `/create` suffix.

Run: `python app.py` → `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

---

## 4. Working rules

- **Don't rebuild the toolchain.** No bundler, no TS migration, no component
  library. It's intentionally a single React file.
- **Don't add auth plumbing as "scaffolding for later."** YAGNI.
- **Don't commit `closeapp.db`, `.env`, or anything under `__pycache__/`.**
- **Branch discipline.** Develop on the feature branch the user named in
  the task; never push to `main` without explicit permission.
- **Before declaring a UI task done**: start the server, `curl` the affected
  endpoints, and confirm the rendered HTML no longer contains the removed
  element (`grep` it).
- **Be honest about scope.** If the user asked for X and you also noticed Y,
  mention Y — don't silently fix it, don't silently ignore it.

### 4a. Before you start: check for prior work

The single biggest failure mode on this repo is agents reinventing work
that another session already finished on a different branch. **Before
writing any code**, spend 60 seconds doing this:

1. `git fetch --all --prune`
2. `git branch -r | grep claude/` — list every parallel branch.
3. For each branch that sounds related to the current task, run
   `git log --oneline master..origin/<branch>` and read the commit
   subjects. You are looking for: "did someone already do this?"
4. If you find prior work, **stop and tell the user**, with the branch
   name and a one-line summary. Let them choose between:
   - "Use that branch — merge it to master."
   - "Start fresh from master, ignore that branch."
   - "Rebase the old branch on current master and finish it."

Do **not** silently start a new branch and redo the work. That is how
we ended up with eight duplicate login-removal branches.

### 4b. Branch hygiene

The default branch on this repo is **`master`** (not `main`). All the
rules below refer to `master`.

- **Always start from `master`.** Before opening a new feature branch:
  `git checkout master && git pull origin master`. Don't branch off a
  half-finished `claude/...` branch unless the user explicitly says so.
- **Merge back to `master` as soon as a feature works.** A green branch
  that sits unmerged for a week becomes a merge conflict. After the
  user confirms a fix is good in the browser, propose merging to
  `master` and deleting the branch.
- **One open feature branch at a time, ideally.** If a second branch is
  already open, ask the user whether to land it first or rebase on top
  of it before starting the new work.
- **Never delete a branch the user hasn't seen working.** Confirm it's
  merged (or its work is captured elsewhere) before deletion.

### Don't leave scratch files in the project root

Past sessions have left behind files like `app.OLD.py`, `app_new.py`,
`debug_recon.py`, `test_login.py`, `frontend_api.jsx`, `Hello.py`. These
make it impossible to tell what's real. Rules:

- **No `*.OLD.py`, `*_new.py`, `*_old.*`, `_backup.*` files.** If you need
  to keep an old version around, that's what git history is for — make a
  commit instead.
- **No throwaway scripts in the project root.** If you genuinely need a
  one-off debug script, put it under `scratch/` (which is in
  `.gitignore`) and tell the user it's there.
- **If you find existing scratch files**, list them for the user and ask
  which to delete — don't silently remove them, and don't silently
  leave them lying around.

---

## 5. Quick sanity checklist for the next agent

Before you push anything that touches auth or the index page:

- [ ] `grep -n "LoginScreen\|handleLogin\|handleLogout\|/api/auth/login\|/api/auth/logout" static/index.html` returns nothing.
- [ ] `grep -n "check_password_hash\|session\[" app.py` returns nothing.
- [ ] `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/auth/me` returns `"authenticated": true` with no cookie sent.
- [ ] `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/dashboard` returns `200`, not `401`.
- [ ] `git log origin/<your-branch> --oneline` shows your new commit.

If any of those fail, the task is not done.

## 6. Closing out a feature branch

When the user confirms a fix works in the browser:

1. From the project folder, on the feature branch:
   `git checkout master && git pull origin master`
   `git merge --no-ff <feature-branch>`
   `git push origin master`
2. Delete the local and remote branches:
   `git branch -d <feature-branch>`
   `git push origin --delete <feature-branch>`
3. Tell the user the branch is closed and which commit on `master`
   carries the fix.

Do not skip step 1's `git pull origin master` — `master` may have moved
forward via another branch's merge while you were working.

## 7. Historical branch ledger (as of 2026-04-22 consolidation)

After the "8 parallel branches" cleanup, the state of the repo is:

- **`master`** — now contains the work of `fix-accounting-button-B9RTl`
  (Reports tab with P&L / BS / Cash Flow, KPIs, flux notes, drill-down,
  Excel/CSV export, 4-4-5 fiscal calendar with MTD/QTD/YTD, QB OAuth
  connect, login removal, CRUD route normalization, fresh-DB report fix,
  Privacy/EULA templates, `Start CloseTool.bat` launcher). This is the
  baseline every new branch must start from.
- **`claude/close-tracker-tools-JVRS3`** — *not* merged. Contains a
  different reports flavor (customer / vendor ledgers, GL detail, revenue
  by customer, expense by vendor, by-Jira-epic) plus QB deep-sync of 23
  entities, trial-balance snapshots, close-report PDF, audit trail,
  calendar view, bulk actions, recon attachments, templates, flux
  analysis, review queue. Kept as a reference; merging it requires real
  conflict resolution against the `master` Reports tab.
- **`claude/close-tool-next-steps-8Y8oZ`** — *not* merged. Period
  rollover, period close/reopen, SMTP + Slack notifications, activity
  timeline.
- **`claude/review-close-tool-dG5XJ`** — *not* merged. Security
  hardening: CSRF tokens, login rate-limit, SQL column whitelist, Fernet
  token encryption, CORS origin whitelist. Self-contained; a candidate
  for the next consolidation pass.
- **`claude/organize-files-JGYzh`** — *not* merged. Moves the tool into
  a `close-tool/` subfolder for multi-project workspace layout.
  Conflicts with every other branch.
- **`claude/month-end-close-tool-5eQcQ`** — *not* merged. Early manual
  schema + fiscal-period seed, authored by Joe. Superseded by §7's
  4-4-5 calendar on `master`.
- **`claude/fix-login-screen-removal-2EuuX`**, **`claude/remove-login-screen-Rc77n`** —
  obsolete. The login is already removed on `master`. Safe to delete
  once Joe confirms.

When in doubt, ask Joe before merging or deleting any of these.
