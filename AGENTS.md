# AGENTS.md — Read Before Touching This Repo

This file is the source of truth for any AI agent (Claude, Copilot, Cursor,
etc.) working on CloseTool. It is also valid as `CLAUDE.md`. If guidance here
conflicts with a passing remark in chat, **this file wins** unless the user
explicitly overrides it in writing.

---

## 0. Pre-flight: are you in the right place?

Before doing **anything** — reading files, running commands, planning —
verify all three:

1. **Canonical project path** (Windows):
   `C:\Users\Joe\OneDrive - Healthcare Markets DBA\Desktop\Claude Projects\CloseTool`
   This is the *only* folder that contains the real CloseTool. Other
   `app.py` files on Joe's machine (`C:\Users\Joe\app.py`,
   `C:\Users\Joe\Downloads\app.py`, `C:\Users\Joe\Desktop\Claude Projects\close-tracker\app.py`)
   are stale graveyards. Do not edit them. Do not "merge" from them.
2. **You are inside a git repo whose remote is**
   `gutte001-lgtm/-C-Users-Joe-OneDrive...-Desktop-Accounting-Tools`.
   Run `git remote -v` to confirm. If it says anything else (or "fatal:
   not a git repository"), you are in the wrong folder — stop and tell
   the user.
3. **You are not in `C:\Users\Joe`.** That folder accidentally became a
   git repo once. Never run `git init`, `git add`, or `git commit` from
   `C:\Users\Joe` or any folder outside the canonical project path.
   If `git status` from `C:\Users\Joe` ever shows a branch name,
   the home-folder `.git` has reappeared and must be deleted before
   doing anything else.

Sanity check — run inside the project folder, all should pass:

```
git remote -v        # → ...gutte001-lgtm/...Accounting-Tools
git rev-parse --show-toplevel   # → ...\Claude Projects\CloseTool
ls app.py            # → file exists
```

---

## 1. The #1 rule: there is no login screen

CloseTool runs locally on the owner's machine (`http://127.0.0.1:5000`) as a
single-tenant accounting tool. The login screen has been **permanently
removed**. Do not reintroduce it, and do not add any auth gate — session,
token, basic-auth, OAuth, SSO, magic link, PIN, or otherwise — without
explicit written instruction from the repo owner (Joe).

### How "no login" is wired today

Backend (`app.py`):
- `get_current_user()` always returns user id `DEFAULT_USER_ID` (1 = Joe, admin).
- `login_required` and `admin_required` are **no-op pass-throughs**. The
  decorators are left on routes intentionally so that if auth is ever
  reinstated on purpose, the surface area is already marked. Do not strip
  them — that's churn, and it loses the signal.
- `/api/auth/me` always responds `authenticated: true` with Joe's profile.
- `/api/auth/login` and `/api/auth/logout` have been deleted. If a stale
  client calls them the 404 is intentional.
- Neither `session` nor `check_password_hash` nor `generate_password_hash`
  are imported anymore.

Database / `init_db.py`:
- The `users` table has no `username` or `password_hash` columns. Don't
  add them back.
- Don't ALTER TABLE the schema to re-introduce auth columns. The legacy
  `setup_auth.py` script has been deleted from the repo for this reason.

Frontend (`static/index.html`):
- The `LoginScreen` component has been deleted.
- The `authChecked` state and the `if(!currentUser) return <LoginScreen/>`
  gate have been deleted. On load, the app calls `/api/auth/me`, seeds
  `currentUser` with Joe, and drops straight into the dashboard.
- The "Sign Out" button has been removed from the sidebar.
- `handleLogout` has been deleted.
- The Add User and Edit User modals do not collect `username` or
  `password`. The Settings → Team Members table shows `Email`, not
  `Username`. Don't add those fields back.

### If the user asks you to re-add auth

1. Ask first. Confirm scope (who needs to log in, is it multi-user now,
   network-exposed?).
2. Update this file in the same PR.
3. Do not just "wire up the existing login screen" — it no longer exists.

---

## 2. Why this matters (two real incidents, both about duplicated work)

### 2a. The "crossed swords" incident (2026-04-21)

An agent claimed to have removed the login screen overnight on branch
`claude/fix-login-screen-removal-2EuuX`. In fact, **nothing was committed
or pushed** — only the initial commit existed. The user came back the
next morning, still saw the login screen, and (reasonably) lost trust.

### 2b. The "8 parallel branches" incident (2026-04-22)

A week of sessions produced eight `claude/*` branches — each branching
off the original `master` (initial commit only), each solving the same
problems in isolation:

| Problem | Solved (again) on branch |
| --- | --- |
| Remove login screen | `fix-login-screen-removal-2EuuX`, `remove-login-screen-Rc77n`, `fix-accounting-button-B9RTl`, `close-tool-next-steps-8Y8oZ` |
| Add reports | `close-tracker-tools-JVRS3` (canned ledgers), `fix-accounting-button-B9RTl` (P&L/BS/CF + KPIs) |
| Fiscal calendar / periods | `month-end-close-tool-5eQcQ`, `fix-accounting-button-B9RTl` |
| `.gitignore` for pycache | `close-tool-next-steps-8Y8oZ`, `review-close-tool-dG5XJ`, `remove-login-screen-Rc77n`, …every new branch |

Nothing landed on `master`. The user's local `git pull` on `master`
fetched the initial commit and nothing else, so every session's "it's
fixed" looked like a lie from the user's chair. The eventual cleanup
required surveying every branch, picking one (`fix-accounting-button-B9RTl`)
as canonical, and fast-forwarding `master` to it.

### Lessons, in priority order

1. **If you say you did it, it must be committed AND pushed to the named
   branch.** Run `git log --oneline origin/<branch>` before declaring victory.
2. **Verify the change actually reaches the user.** For UI changes that
   means: boot the app, hit the URL, confirm the old screen is gone. A
   passing test or a clean diff is not proof the user will see the fix.
3. **Check for prior work before starting.** See §4a. The user almost
   certainly already asked another agent to do this. Look.
4. **Do not leave the task partway and claim completion.** If you ran out
   of turns, say so explicitly in the final message.
5. **Never undo a previous agent's completed work without a stated reason.**
   If you find the login screen back in `index.html`, treat it as a
   regression — check git history, ask the user, and restore the no-auth
   state. Do not "helpfully" add auth back.

---

## 3. Project shape (quick map)

- `app.py` — Flask API + static file server. Single file on purpose.
- `init_db.py` — schema + seed data. Idempotent; safe to re-run.
- `static/index.html` — Single-file React app (Babel-standalone, no build
  step). Edit this file directly.
- `closeapp.db` — SQLite, created on first run. Git-ignored.
- `requirements.txt` — pip deps.

(There used to be a `setup_auth.py` here that added username/password
columns. It has been deleted. See Section 1.)

### API conventions

- Resource creation is `POST /api/<resource>` (not `/api/<resource>/create`).
  This applies to `users`, `categories`, `tasks`, `periods`, and
  `reconciliations`. The frontend assumes this convention — don't reintroduce
  the `/create` suffix.

Run: `python app.py` → `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

---

## 4. Working rules

- **Don't rebuild the toolchain.** No bundler, no TS migration, no component
  library. It's intentionally a single React file.
- **Don't add auth plumbing as "scaffolding for later."** YAGNI.
- **Don't commit `closeapp.db`, `.env`, or anything under `__pycache__/`.**
- **Branch discipline.** Develop on the feature branch the user named in
  the task; never push to `main` without explicit permission.
- **Before declaring a UI task done**: start the server, `curl` the affected
  endpoints, and confirm the rendered HTML no longer contains the removed
  element (`grep` it).
- **Be honest about scope.** If the user asked for X and you also noticed Y,
  mention Y — don't silently fix it, don't silently ignore it.

### 4a. Before you start: check for prior work

The single biggest failure mode on this repo is agents reinventing work
that another session already finished on a different branch. **Before
writing any code**, spend 60 seconds doing this:

1. `git fetch --all --prune`
2. `git branch -r | grep claude/` — list every parallel branch.
3. For each branch that sounds related to the current task, run
   `git log --oneline master..origin/<branch>` and read the commit
   subjects. You are looking for: "did someone already do this?"
4. If you find prior work, **stop and tell the user**, with the branch
   name and a one-line summary. Let them choose between:
   - "Use that branch — merge it to master."
   - "Start fresh from master, ignore that branch."
   - "Rebase the old branch on current master and finish it."

Do **not** silently start a new branch and redo the work. That is how
we ended up with eight duplicate login-removal branches.

### 4b. Branch hygiene

The default branch on this repo is **`master`** (not `main`). All the
rules below refer to `master`.

- **Always start from `master`.** Before opening a new feature branch:
  `git checkout master && git pull origin master`. Don't branch off a
  half-finished `claude/...` branch unless the user explicitly says so.
- **Merge back to `master` as soon as a feature works.** A green branch
  that sits unmerged for a week becomes a merge conflict. After the
  user confirms a fix is good in the browser, propose merging to
  `master` and deleting the branch.
- **One open feature branch at a time, ideally.** If a second branch is
  already open, ask the user whether to land it first or rebase on top
  of it before starting the new work.
- **Never delete a branch the user hasn't seen working.** Confirm it's
  merged (or its work is captured elsewhere) before deletion.

### Don't leave scratch files in the project root

Past sessions have left behind files like `app.OLD.py`, `app_new.py`,
`debug_recon.py`, `test_login.py`, `frontend_api.jsx`, `Hello.py`. These
make it impossible to tell what's real. Rules:

- **No `*.OLD.py`, `*_new.py`, `*_old.*`, `_backup.*` files.** If you need
  to keep an old version around, that's what git history is for — make a
  commit instead.
- **No throwaway scripts in the project root.** If you genuinely need a
  one-off debug script, put it under `scratch/` (which is in
  `.gitignore`) and tell the user it's there.
- **If you find existing scratch files**, list them for the user and ask
  which to delete — don't silently remove them, and don't silently
  leave them lying around.

---

### 4c. Security posture (as of 2026-04-22 hardening pass)

The app runs on `127.0.0.1:5000` as a single-user local tool, but defense
in depth is still cheap:

- **`SECRET_KEY`** (Flask session signing) is required. If not set in
  `.env`, `app.py` auto-generates one on first run and appends it to
  `.env`. The hardcoded fallback is gone.
- **`TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`** (Fernet, `cryptography>=42`) encrypts
  QuickBooks access/refresh tokens at rest in `closeapp.db`. Same
  auto-generate-and-persist behaviour as `SECRET_KEY`. Legacy plaintext
  rows are read transparently — no migration needed.
- **CORS**: `add_cors()` only emits ACAO for origins in
  `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (default includes `http://127.0.0.1:5000` and
  `http://localhost:5000`). Cross-origin wildcards + credentials are
  gone.
- **Session cookies**: `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, and `Secure` via
  `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=1` if you ever expose over HTTPS.
- **CSRF**: `/api/auth/me` issues a per-session `csrf_token`. Every
  POST/PATCH/PUT/DELETE route is decorated with `@csrf_protect` and
  verifies the `X-CSRF-Token` header. The frontend `api()` helper in
  `static/index.html` captures the token from any response that
  includes one and attaches it automatically. Do **not** remove
  `@csrf_protect` from a mutating endpoint; add it to any new one.
- **SQL**: dynamic `UPDATE` statements go through `safe_update(table,
  pk_col, allowed_cols, updates, pk_value)` which whitelists every
  column name. Do not reintroduce raw `f"UPDATE ... SET {k}=?"` builders.

What deliberately was **not** ported from
`claude/review-close-tool-dG5XJ`:

- Rate-limit on `/api/auth/login` — the endpoint is gone (see §1).
- `setup_auth.py` password hardening — the file is gone (see §1).

## 5. Quick sanity checklist for the next agent

Before you push anything that touches auth, security, or the index page:

- [ ] `grep -n "LoginScreen\|handleLogin\|handleLogout\|/api/auth/login\|/api/auth/logout" static/index.html` returns nothing.
- [ ] `grep -n "check_password_hash" app.py` returns nothing.
- [ ] `grep -n 'f"UPDATE' app.py` shows only the one line inside `safe_update()`.
- [ ] Every `POST`/`PATCH`/`DELETE` route in `app.py` has both its auth
      decorator (`@login_required`/`@admin_required`) and `@csrf_protect`.
- [ ] `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/auth/me` returns `"authenticated": true` and a `csrf_token`.
- [ ] `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/dashboard` returns `200`, not `401`.
- [ ] A POST without `X-CSRF-Token` returns `403`, with the right token returns `200/201`.
- [ ] `git log origin/<your-branch> --oneline` shows your new commit.

If any of those fail, the task is not done.

## 6. Closing out a feature branch

When the user confirms a fix works in the browser:

1. From the project folder, on the feature branch:
   `git checkout master && git pull origin master`
   `git merge --no-ff <feature-branch>`
   `git push origin master`
2. Delete the local and remote branches:
   `git branch -d <feature-branch>`
   `git push origin --delete <feature-branch>`
3. Tell the user the branch is closed and which commit on `master`
   carries the fix.

Do not skip step 1's `git pull origin master` — `master` may have moved
forward via another branch's merge while you were working.

---

## 7. Historical branch ledger (as of 2026-04-22 consolidation + hardening)

After the "8 parallel branches" cleanup and the follow-up security
hardening port, the state of the repo is:

- **`master`** — carries the fast-forward from
  `claude/fix-accounting-button-B9RTl` (Reports tab with P&L / BS /
  Cash Flow, KPIs, flux notes, drill-down, Excel/CSV export, 4-4-5
  fiscal calendar with MTD/QTD/YTD, QB OAuth connect, login removal,
  CRUD route normalization, fresh-DB report fix, Privacy/EULA
  templates, `Start CloseTool.bat` launcher) **plus** the security
  hardening ported from `claude/review-close-tool-dG5XJ` (see §4c)
  **plus** the QuickBooks bootstrap + connect-diagnostics merge from
  `claude/fix-quickbooks-connection-Jhw21` (2026-04-22):
  `_activate_current_period_if_stale()` auto-advances `is_active` to
  today's 4-4-5 month when the active period ended >60 days ago;
  `sync_qb_accounts(period_id)` upserts a reconciliation row per BS
  account from the real QB chart of accounts; `/api/qb/sync` returns
  `{created, updated, total}`; new `/api/qb/bootstrap` one-click
  (activate month + seed recons + pull P&L/BS/CF for month/quarter/
  year); Settings → QuickBooks "Initialize from QuickBooks" button;
  stale-period banner on Reconciliations; OAuth callback returns a
  specific `reason` code per failure branch and persists state in
  `qb_oauth_states` so it survives `localhost` vs `127.0.0.1` cookie
  drops; `/api/qb/connect` fails fast when `QB_CLIENT_ID`/`SECRET`
  aren't set
  **plus** the QuickBooks reporting/history + close-period + diagnose
  merge from `claude/fix-quickbooks-sync-PPv7R` (2026-04-23) — three
  stacked features:
  (a) Historical sweep: `sync_qb_recons_from_bs(period_id)` derives
  per-period reconciliations from each period's cached Balance Sheet
  (correct historical ending balances, unlike the current-balance stamp
  from `sync_qb_accounts`); `sync_history_range(start, end)` iterates
  every 4-4-5 month/quarter/year overlapping the window and pulls
  P&L/BS/CF + derives recons; new `/api/qb/sync_history` endpoint and
  `/api/qb/bootstrap` now sweeps 2024-01-01 → today by default
  (`skip_history: true` to opt out). Frontend: Reconciliations tab
  gained a period dropdown + "↻ Sync This Period" button; Reports
  gained a "⇣ Sync History" button and a real error string instead of
  `JSON.stringify(results)`.
  (b) Close-period workflow: new `periods` columns `is_closed`,
  `closed_at`, `closed_by` (idempotent ALTER in
  `_ensure_period_close_columns()`). `_backfill_closed_once()` runs on
  first-ever startup and marks every month whose `end_date` is strictly
  before the most-recently-ended month as closed — so Joe lands on the
  prior completed month instead of January 2022.
  `_activate_current_close_period()` picks the earliest month with
  `is_closed=0` as the active close period; replaces
  `_activate_current_period_if_stale()` (kept as alias). New endpoints
  `POST /api/periods/<id>/close` and `POST /api/periods/<id>/reopen`;
  `/close` auto-advances `is_active` to the next unclosed month.
  Frontend sidebar "CLOSE PERIOD" dropdown + "✓ Close This Period"
  button; changing the dropdown flips `is_active` and refetches
  Dashboard / Checklist / Reconciliations so the whole close workflow
  moves together. Reports keeps its own independent period picker;
  Reconciliations follows the global close period by default but keeps
  its own dropdown for historical peeking.
  (c) Richer compare modes + diagnostics on Reports. `_prior_period_id()`
  now handles `prev`, `prev2`, `prev3`, `yoy`, `yoy2`, `ytd`, `ytd_ly`,
  plus caller-supplied `compare_to=<id>` for Custom. New
  `GET /api/qb/diagnose?period_id=X&rtype=pl` hits the QB reports API
  directly and returns URL, HTTP status, top-level row count, flattened
  row count, and first 12 sample lines — no side effects. Frontend
  compare dropdown adds "Prior period / 2-3 periods ago / Prior year /
  Two years ago / This fiscal year (YTD) / Prior fiscal year / Custom…"
  (Custom reveals a second dropdown of every cached period, type-tagged).
  Empty-state distinguishes "Not yet synced" from "QuickBooks returned
  zero rows" and suggests likely causes (empty company, sandbox/prod
  mix, accounting method). New "🔎 Diagnose" button — reach for this
  when sync succeeds but Reports stay empty.
  Plus a React error boundary so a render crash shows a message instead
  of a blank screen.
  This is the baseline every new branch must start from.

### Remaining unmerged branches

- **`claude/close-tracker-tools-JVRS3`** — a *different* reports flavor
  (customer / vendor ledgers, GL detail, revenue by customer, expense
  by vendor, by-Jira-epic) plus QB deep-sync of 23 entities,
  trial-balance snapshots, close-report PDF, audit trail, calendar
  view, bulk actions, recon attachments, templates, flux analysis,
  review queue. Kept for reference; merging it requires real conflict
  resolution against the `master` Reports tab.
- **`claude/close-tool-next-steps-8Y8oZ`** — period rollover, period
  close/reopen, SMTP + Slack notifications, activity timeline. Good
  next-consolidation candidate.
- **`claude/organize-files-JGYzh`** — moves the tool into a
  `close-tool/` subfolder for multi-project workspace layout.
  Conflicts with every other branch.
- **`claude/month-end-close-tool-5eQcQ`** — early manual schema +
  fiscal-period seed, authored by Joe. Superseded by the 4-4-5
  calendar on `master`; kept for archive.

### Deleted branches (2026-04-22)

- `claude/fix-accounting-button-B9RTl` — landed on `master`.
- `claude/review-close-tool-dG5XJ` — consumed by the security port.
- `claude/fix-login-screen-removal-2EuuX`,
  `claude/remove-login-screen-Rc77n` — obsolete (login already removed
  on `master`).
- `claude/fix-quickbooks-connection-Jhw21` — landed on `master` via
  `--no-ff` merge (QB bootstrap + connect-diagnostics).

### Merged branches (2026-04-23)

- `claude/fix-quickbooks-sync-PPv7R` — landed on `master` via `--no-ff`
  merge (QB history sweep, close-period workflow, compare modes +
  `/api/qb/diagnose`, React error boundary). Remote branch kept until
  Joe confirms it works in the browser, then delete per §6.
- `claude/fix-qb-reporting-sync-3gSlS` — landed on `master` via `--no-ff`
  merge `51b249e` (Reconciliations-tab crash fix: hoisted `qbStatus`
  state out of `Settings()` and into `CloseApp()` so
  `Reconciliations()` can reach it via closure; prior version threw
  `ReferenceError: qbStatus is not defined` on render). Single-commit
  branch; remote deleted after merge.

When in doubt, ask Joe before merging or deleting any of the
unmerged-but-still-present branches above.
